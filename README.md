# universe-test
Run this code: 'sudo python3 main.py' 

This was part of the challenge of one of Sirajology's videos. We had to try and utilize Universe to create a bot that plays a racegame. However this package is fairly new and finding documentation was pretty hard. Going to revisit this later once I have a deeper knowledge of 'Deep Q Learning'.

Would have loved to play around with the bot more, but I had other obligations and I wanted to deliver something before the end of the contest.
